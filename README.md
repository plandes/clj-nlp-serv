# RESTful Natural Language Parse Service

A RESTful service that service NLP parsing requests.  This makes
the [NLP parsing project](https://github.com/plandes/clj-nlp-parse) available
as a [REST service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).


## Documentation

Additional [documentation](https://plandes.github.io/clj-nlp-serv/codox/index.html).


## Usage

You can use this as a command line program to generate a prettyprint parse tree
of an utterance.  However, you have to let it know where the
Stanford CoreNLP libraries are configured (see the
[NLP parse project setup docs](https://github.com/plandes/clj-nlp-parse#setup)
for more information.

To create the command line utility, do the following:

- Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) (this is just a script)
- Install [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- Download the source:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/clj-nlp-parse
```
- Follow the directions in [build section](#building)
- Edit and uncomment the `makefile` to set the `ZMODEL` variable, which should
  be set to a directory having the stanford POS model(s) in `standford/pos`.
- Build the distribution binaries:
```bash
$ make dist
```
If everything goes well and you are lucky a new folder should show up on your
desktop with everything you need to run it.  To do that:
```bash
$ cd ~/Desktop/parse/bin
$ ./nlparse parse -u 'I am Paul Landes'
```

Now start the RESTful service, on say, port 9000 (defaults to 8080):
```bash
$ ./nlparse service -p 9000'
```

Use a web client to test the service using the *pretty print* option:
```bash
$ wget -q -O - 'http://localhost:9000/parse?utterance=My+name+is+Paul+Landes&pretty=true'
```

The output:
```json
{"text":"My name is Paul Landes",
 "mentions":
 [{"entity-type":"PERSON",
   "token-range":[3, 5],
   "ner-tag":"PERSON",
   "sent-index":0,
   "char-range":[11, 22],
   "text":"Paul Landes"}],
 "tok-re-mentions":[],
 "coref":
 [{"id":1,
   "mention":
   [{"sent-index":1,
     "token-range":[4, 6],
     "head-index":5,
     "gender":"MALE",
     "animacy":"ANIMATE",
     "type":"PROPER",
     "number":"SINGULAR"}]},
```

**Note:** I will make the distribution binaries available on request.


### Usage Help

For convenience, here's the usage docs you get when invoking with no
parameters:
```sql
$ nlparse
repl	start a repl either on the command line or headless with -h
  -h, --headless            start an nREPL server
  -p, --port NUMBER  12345  the port bind for the repl server

 parse	parse an English utterance
  -l, --level LOG LEVEL  INFO  Log level to set in the Log4J2 system.
  -u, --utterance TEXT         The utterance to parse
  -p, --pretty                 Pretty print the JSON string

 service	start the agent parse website and service
  -p, --port PORT  8080  the port bind for web site/service

 version	Get the version of the application.
  -g, --gitref
```


## Building

All [leiningen](http://leiningen.org) tasks will work in this project.  For
additional build functionality (like building the command line application and
git tag convenience utility functionality) clone the
[Clojure build repo](https://github.com/plandes/clj-zenbuild) in the same
(parent of this file) directory as this project:
```bash
   cd ..
   git clone https://github.com/plandes/clj-zenbuild
```
